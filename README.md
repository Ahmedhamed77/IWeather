[![Moove It](https://circleci.com/gh/moove-it/react-native-template.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/moove-it/react-native-template?branch=master)

This project is using weatheOpenmap to provide info about weather for cities around the world.

## Base dependencies

- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for networking.
- [react-native-linear-gradient](https://github.com/react-native-linear-gradient/react-native-linear-gradient) for card color design.
- [compose-function](https://github.com/stoeffel/compose-function) inorder to hold providers for the app.

## Usage



- Go to your project's root folder and run `yarn`.
- If you are using Xcode 12.5 or higher got to /ios and execute `pod install`
- Run `yarn ios` or `yarn android` to start your application!


## Folder structure

This template follows a very simple project structure:

- `src`: This folder is the main container of all the code inside your application.
  - `screens`: Folder that contains all your application screens/features.
    - `Screen`: Each screen should be stored inside its folder and inside it a file for its code and a separate one for the styles and tests.
      - `Screen.tsx`
      - `Screen.styles.tsx`
  - `shared` : this folder containt all shared file in the project
    - `api` : Folder to store api request and types of each request
    - `components`: Folder to store any common component that you use through your app (such as a generic button)
    - `providers`: Folder which hold all provider of the app such as navigationContainer and reduxProvider
    - `styles`: this contains all colors enum and if we have common style
    - `utils` : utilities for the app
  - `navigation`: Folder to store the navigators.
  - `reducers`: This folder should have all your reducers, and expose the combined result using its `index.js`
  - `redux` : Folder to store all redux actions, reducers, types and configration.
  - `App.tsx`: Main component that starts your whole app.
  - `index.tsx`: Entry point of your application as per React-Native standards.


## Components

Components are the basic blocks of a react native application, but since we​​ aim to minimize development complexity, all the components are at the same nesting level.

Another important thing is the use of propTypes to check the kind of data that your components need to work properly. If the component receives some data from others, the type of these props must be defined, and in case you need it the default value of the property too.

## Redux

Once the components are defined, they are tied to the management of information through the application. For this, Redux is implemented with the store-reducer-action structure as usual, however, not only the data is handled through the actions but the success and error responses are also defined by the same form.

### Controllers folder and API connection handler

To keep the networking layer simple, the template uses a single Axios instance in the `httpClient.js`. It uses interceptors to define common side effects for the responses.

When you need communication with a service you have to create a function to manage the operation and grouping according to the kind of transaction inside a controller file, please keep all of those inside the controllers' folder.

While the data transfer between the API and the app is working you must use the success and error actions that help you to catch the result of the operation. With this method, you can track the interaction through the redux store. This is useful because you can create behaviors based on those states in a quick and simple way

### Redux folders

4 folders divide the redux work

- Store: Here you define the store shape and you can configure the persistReducer and middlewares.
- Actions: Remember to create the file and the corresponding test for each action classification. Here you define actions for success and error scenarios.
- Reducers: You have the error and success reducers by default. Create the other classifications and try to keep simple each file. Here you modify the store.
- Selectors: Create one file for each action classification. Here you define what part of the store you need to see in your interface.

## Screens

In this folder, you have the main objects to apply the composition architecture. Just create a folder for each screen you have in your application, call all the components and static resources you need to render the scene and finally use the corresponding hooks to interact with redux and create behaviors depending on the store.

To keep the structure, extract the styles from the main file and place it in a {namefile.styles.tsx}
